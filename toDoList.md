List of things I've noticed that aren't issues per-say but should be addressed:

 - Resolution of planted flowers
 - Resolution of movement angles
 - Menus, of course.
 - Right/Left arrows reversed?
 - Can move map off screen
 - flowers grow too much
 - graphics lag when doing lots of calculations...? Might be drawing too many flowers.
